# FirstCode
Just some code I want to share...

The essence of my project: the computer generates a number from 1 to 50, and you have to guess it. If the number you entered is less than the one you guessed, then you will be asked to add another number, and if the number you wrote is greater than the one you guessed, then you will be asked to subtract another number.
At the end, you will be told for how many attempts you guessed the number. Yes, stupid...
